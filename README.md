# Basics-to-Website-Marketing-Challenge

## Accessibility
Accessibility is important for any website hoping to be readily available to all potential readers, and it is important for any website hoping to be optimized for search engines. This repository was created to update the existing code given to us in order for it to meet these accessibility standards.

## Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML was added to various parts of the provided HTML. Semantic HTML makes it better for screen readers to peruse the webpage and provides clearer information on the structure of what exactly is being viewed. Semantic HTML also makes for more straightforward code, as there were various parts to the code that used divisions where it was not necessary, including one instance where an image was input through a division class in CSS, which would prevent a screenreader from having any information on the image.

## Alt Attributes
Alt attributes are important on images and icons as otherwise screenreaders have to go through the entire link which can be confusing and disorienting. Alt attributes were added to all images. In the case of the icons; there was no particular description that was necessary, as the image was only there for reference to the sections they pertained to, so an empty alt attribute was used so that it would not read through the link and instead explain an image was located there, though it is one for which a description is unnecessary.
